When you download, you must put the 'colors' and 'teamImages' folders in the 'assets' folder that is in the main MLB directory. It would not let me upload all the colors/images under the MLB directory.

Also, you can ignore the two .plist files and the .swift file that are outside the MLB folder, it would not let me delete them once uploaded.
